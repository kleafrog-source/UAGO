You are helping to debug a p5.js visualization that encountered an error. Your task is to analyze the error and provide a fixed version of the code.

**Error Context:**
The following error occurred while running the visualization:
```
{error}
```

**Current Code:**
```javascript
{current_code}
```

**Instructions:**
1. Carefully read and understand the error message.
2. Identify the root cause of the error in the code.
3. Provide a complete, fixed version of the p5.js sketch.
4. Add error handling to prevent similar issues.
5. Include comments explaining the changes made.

**Requirements:**
- The fixed code must be a complete, runnable p5.js sketch.
- Include all necessary function definitions and variable declarations.
- Add appropriate error handling.
- Ensure the visualization remains visually similar to the original intent.

**Output Format:**
Provide only the fixed JavaScript code wrapped in triple backticks (```javascript ... ```). Do not include any explanations outside the code block.
