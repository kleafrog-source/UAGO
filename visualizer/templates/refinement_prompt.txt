You are helping to refine a p5.js visualization based on an error that occurred. Below is the current code and the error message. Please fix the code to resolve the error while maintaining the original visualization intent.

**Current Code:**
```javascript
{current_code}
```

**Error Message:**
```
{error}
```

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze the error message and identify the root cause.
2. Modify the code to fix the error while preserving the visualization's purpose.
3. Ensure the code follows p5.js best practices.
4. Add or update comments to explain any significant changes.

**Requirements:**
- The fixed code must be a complete, runnable p5.js sketch.
- Include all necessary function definitions and variable declarations.
- Maintain compatibility with the original visualization approach.

**Output Format:**
Provide only the fixed JavaScript code wrapped in triple backticks (```javascript ... ```). Do not include any explanations outside the code block.
