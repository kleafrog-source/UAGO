You are an expert in generative geometry and visualization. Your task is to create a p5.js sketch that visualizes a geometric structure based on the following analysis from UAGO (Universal Adaptive Geometric Observer).

**Model Information:**
```json
{model_info}
```

**Hypotheses:**
```json
{hypotheses}
```

**Geometric Invariants:**
```json
{invariants}
```

**Instructions:**
1. Create a p5.js sketch that visually represents the geometric structure described by the model and invariants.
2. Use the hypotheses to guide the visualization style and parameters.
3. Include interactive controls if they enhance understanding.
4. The code should be self-contained and work in a standard p5.js environment.
5. Add comments to explain the visualization approach.

**Requirements:**
- Must include both setup() and draw() functions
- Use the model parameters to drive the visualization
- Include appropriate visual feedback for the invariants
- Ensure the visualization is responsive to the canvas size

**Output Format:**
Provide only the JavaScript code wrapped in triple backticks (```javascript ... ```). Do not include any explanations outside the code block.

**Example Output Structure:**
```javascript
function setup() {
  // Initialize canvas and settings
}

function draw() {
  // Main drawing loop
}

// Additional helper functions as needed
```
